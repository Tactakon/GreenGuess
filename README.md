(((Spider plant)))
Spider plants are fairly adaptable and can grow in a wide range of temperatures. However, they generally prefer temperatures between 60-75°F (15-24°C) during the day and 55-65°F (12-18°C) at night. They can tolerate higher temperatures up to 90°F (32°C) but may not grow as well.

It's also important to note that spider plants are sensitive to cold drafts, so avoid placing them near doors or windows where they may be exposed to cold air. Additionally, make sure to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged, as overwatering can also harm the plant.

Spider plants prefer to be kept consistently moist, but not waterlogged. Ideally, the soil should be evenly moist, but not soggy or dripping with water. Overwatering can lead to root rot and other issues, so it's important to allow the top layer of soil to dry out slightly before watering again.

To check the moisture level, insert your finger into the soil about an inch deep. If the soil feels dry at this depth, it's time to water your spider plant. If the soil feels damp, you can wait a bit longer before watering. It's also a good idea to use a well-draining potting mix and ensure that the pot has drainage holes to prevent water from accumulating in the bottom.

Spider plants are adaptable and can tolerate a range of humidity levels. However, they generally prefer moderate to high humidity levels, ideally between 40-60%. If the air in your home is dry, especially during the winter months or in air-conditioned spaces, you may need to increase humidity levels by using a humidifier or placing a tray of water near the plant. Alternatively, you can mist the plant's leaves regularly to increase humidity levels around the plant. However, be careful not to mist the plant too much, as this can lead to fungal growth or other problems.

(((Snake plant)))

Snake plants are quite adaptable and can tolerate a range of temperature and humidity levels. Generally, they prefer moderate temperatures ranging from 60-80°F (15-27°C) during the day and slightly cooler temperatures at night. They can also tolerate lower temperatures, but it's best to keep them away from cold drafts.
As for humidity, snake plants are quite tolerant of low humidity levels, but they prefer moderate to high humidity levels between 40-60%. If the air in your home is dry, you can increase humidity levels by using a humidifier or placing a tray of water near the plant. Misting the plant's leaves occasionally can also help to increase humidity levels. However, as with spider plants, be careful not to mist the plant too much, as this can lead to fungal growth or other problems.

(((Pothos plant)))

Pothos plants are quite adaptable and can tolerate a range of temperature and humidity levels. Generally, they prefer moderate temperatures ranging from 60-85°F (15-29°C) during the day and slightly cooler temperatures at night. They can also tolerate lower temperatures but can suffer damage from cold drafts.
As for humidity, pothos plants are quite tolerant of low humidity levels, but they prefer moderate to high humidity levels between 40-60%. If the air in your home is dry, you can increase humidity levels by using a humidifier or placing a tray of water near the plant. Misting the plant's leaves occasionally can also help to increase humidity levels. However, as with spider plants and snake plants, be careful not to mist the plant too much, as this can lead to fungal growth or other problems.
